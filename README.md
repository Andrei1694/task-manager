Continuous Integration is the practice of continuously merging code changes from multiple developers into a central repository, and then automatically building and testing the merged code to detect any integration issues early in the development cycle. The main goal of CI is to catch integration issues early and ensure that the codebase is always stable and ready for deployment.

Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are both practices that aim to streamline and accelerate the software development process, but they differ in their objectives and how they are implemented.
ex: code linting

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for deployment to production. However, the actual deployment of the code changes to production is done manually, typically by a human operator. In other words, Continuous Delivery is the practice of automating the software delivery process up to the point of deployment, but the final decision to deploy is made by a human.
ex: frontend and backend tests, QA team tests UAT

On the other hand, Continuous Deployment (CD) is a practice where every code change that passes automated testing is automatically released to production. Unlike Continuous Delivery, in Continuous Deployment, there is no human intervention required to deploy the code changes to production. The system is fully automated, and code changes are automatically deployed to production as soon as they are ready.
\*its not for every product
In summary, Continuous Delivery automates the process of building, testing, and preparing code changes for deployment, while Continuous Deployment goes a step further by automating the actual deployment of the code changes to production.
